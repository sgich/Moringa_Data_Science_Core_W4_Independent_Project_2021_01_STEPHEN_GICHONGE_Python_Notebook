# Data Science Core Independent Project Week 4

## __Hypothesis Testing on Autolib (Electric Car-Sharing) Dataset__ ##


## _Description_ ##

The proliferation of energy efficient and/or clean sources of energy has driven manufacturers to respond to customer and environmental demands as climate change is ever becoming a threat to humanity and it's habitat. 
In response to that, there has been substantial growth in the electric car industry and an unforseen subsector of electric car-sharing. 
The given dataset in this analysis consisted of observations over nine days on electric car (bluecar) ride-sharing for different Postal Codes in Paris, France. Analysis was carried out in the form of a Hypothesis test on two randomly selected Postal Codes in order to understand usage over time.
